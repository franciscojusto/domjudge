Include the sample data (of course)
Timing breakers: root goes to all other nodes, all other nodes are root that point to another
All nodes are their own component
Single cycle
316 independent roots, but everything else connected
Single gate and single edge cases
Most possible complete graph
Straight line case
Two separate components, each with their own real case
Make sure sums go above integer value
Make best possible equal 0
Include case where final gate is huge, first gate is 1, and everything in between is 0 (eliminate greedy possibilities)

Test cases 1-2: Sample data (40, 4)
Test cases 3-4: Straight lines (4999950000 x2)
Test cases 5-7: Single cycle (varying sizes: 4, 100, 100000) (80, 2000, 2000000)
Test cases 8-9: Timing breakers (2, 2)
Test case 10: Each node own component (9001)
Test case 11: Single gate case (1)
Test case 12: Single edge case (3)
Test case 13: Complete graph with 447 gates (overflows int) (447000000000)
Test case 14: Separate components (20)
