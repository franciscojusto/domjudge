			  <h3>How do I register for the competition?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
Simply visit our <a href="register.php">Registration</a> page to sign up. We will send you a confirmation email and you will be ready to compete! 
			    </p>
			  </div>
<h3>Who is able to participate?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
Everyone is able to participate, but in order to receive prizes, the competitor must be a legal resident of the United States or Canada and cannot be a current or former employee of Ultimate Software.
			    </p>
			  </div>
<h3>Where is the competition located?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
The practise competition will be held entirely online, available at <a href="http://www.ulticoder.com/domjudge/public/">here</a>.
			    </p>
			  </div>
<h3>When is the competition?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
The official competition is March 8th 2014, 1PM - 5PM EST. There is also a practise competition on February 13th from 2PM-5PM EST, if you want to try out the judging system.
			    </p>
			  </div>
<h3>What kind of problems can I expect?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
The problems in the competition are algorithm based, with points being awarded for efficiency rather than style. Topics can include any combination of the following: graph theory, combinatorics, number theory, game theory, data structures, calculus, string problems, and dynamic programming.
			    </p>
			  </div>
<h3>What are the constraints for my solution?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
Each submission will be given 5s to run, with Java having an extra 2.5s.
There will also be an maximum memory usage limit of 256MB. These limits are intended to inspire creative ways of finding efficient solutions to hard problems.

The solution must be contained in one file, of size no greater than 256KB.

You may submit a solution to a problem an unlimited number of times, but each incorrect solution will dock you 20 penalty points.
			    </p>
			  </div>
<h3>What languages can I use?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
Submissions will be accepted in Java 7, C, C++, Mono C#, Python (2.7), and Ruby (1.7)
			    </p>
			  </div>
<h3>What if I don't understand a part of the problem?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
There will be opportunities to ask for clarifications. You can submit a clarification request for any problem or a piece of the system, and we will try to respond in a timely fashion. Please note that we cannot give any hints or insight into solutions. Should a wording in the problem statement be deemed ambiguous, all contestants will be notified of the clarification.
			    </p>
			  </div>
<h3>Am I allowed to use the internet?</h3>
			  <div>			    <p>
You may access the internet for API reference only. The practise competition will not be proctored, but we highly recommend sticking to your knowledge and your languageâ€™s API website as the real competition will be.
			    </p>			  </div>
			  <h3>How are rankings determined?</h3>
			  <div>
			    <p>
The judging system will be similar to that of ACM. The contestants will be ranked based on the number of questions solved, and then by least sum of time taken to solve their submissions. There will be unlimited number of submissions, but each incorrect one will be 20 penalty points.
